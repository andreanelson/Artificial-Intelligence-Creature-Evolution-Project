# Artificial-Intelligence-Creature-Evolution-Project
This report details the process and results of adapting a genetic algorithm for evolving creatures to complete the task of climbing a mountain. Building upon the existing Genetic Algorithm/Creatures case study, I integrated a new environment that features a mountain, challenging the creatures to climb as high as possible. The primary objective was to modify the genetic algorithm to evolve creatures capable of achieving this task. This involved adapting the fitness function to prioritize climbing ability, and conducting various experiments to optimize the creatures' performance. The following sections outline the methodology, experiments, and results achieved in this process.
