# Artificial-Intelligence-Creature-Evolution-Project
This project adapts a genetic algorithm to evolve creatures for the task of climbing a mountain. Building on the Genetic Algorithm/Creatures case study, I introduced a new environment and modified the fitness function to prioritize climbing ability. The methodology, experimentation, and results are detailed in the report.
